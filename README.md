## Course Resources

### Steve's coffee shop recipe project

You can download the following zipped folder to have Steve's coffee shop recipes at the beginning. Use this project to following along in the course.
  - [coffee-shop-recipes.zip](https://github.com/a-a-ron/coffee-shop-recipes/files/10885432/coffee-shop-recipes.zip)

### Bash script for "How to Modify and Fix Your Commits" 

Use the following script to generage the 6 files to follow along with `git amend`, `git reset`, and `git reflog`. 

```bash
for d in {1..6}; do touch "file${d}.md"; git add "file${d}.md"; git commit -m "adding file ${d}"; done
```

If you need one for powershell, you can use the following;

```powershell
